//Java operates on the principle of "Write Once, Run Anywhere" (WORA), thanks to its platform-independent nature. 
//Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of how Java works:
//________________________________________
//1. Source Code Compilation
//   •	Java programs are written in .java files using plain text.
//   •	These files are compiled by the Java Compiler (javac) into bytecode, which is stored in .class files.
//   •	Bytecode is a platform-independent, intermediate representation of your program.
//________________________________________
//2. Execution of Bytecode
//   •	The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) executes the bytecode.
//   •	JVM is platform-specific, meaning each operating system has its own implementation of the JVM.
//   •	The JVM interprets the bytecode into machine code that the underlying system can execute.
//________________________________________
//3. Role of the Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
//   •	The JRE provides the libraries and JVM required to run Java applications.
//   •	It acts as an environment where the JVM operates, handling tasks like memory management and garbage collection.
//________________________________________
//4. Key Features Enabling Java's Functionality
//   •	Platform Independence: Bytecode can run on any system with a compatible JVM.
//   •	Garbage Collection: Java automatically manages memory, reducing the risk of memory leaks.
//   •	Just-In-Time (JIT) Compilation: The JIT compiler converts frequently used bytecode into native machine code for 
//    better performance.
//   •	Security: The JVM runs Java code within a secure "sandbox," minimizing risks.
//________________________________________
//  Example Workflow
//    1.	Write Code: Create a HelloWorld.java file.
//    2.	Compile: Run javac HelloWorld.java to produce HelloWorld.class.
//    3.	Run: Execute java HelloWorld, where the JVM processes the bytecode.
//________________________________________
//                                   Why This is Important in an Interview
//Understanding how Java works highlights its strengths like platform independence, robust memory management, and 
//performance optimization. This knowledge demonstrates your grasp of Java's core architecture, which is often a 
//fundamental topic in interviews.
